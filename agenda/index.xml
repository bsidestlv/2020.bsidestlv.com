The year 2012 almost crashed every world economy, threatening to bring the modern world to an end with the first Shamoon attacks by Iran. Since nearly bring the world to it&amp;rsquo;s knees, Iran has launched devastating cyber attacks against it&amp;rsquo;s perceived enemies involving critical infrastructure, to manipulate the oil markets in its favor.</description></item><item><title>CTF announcement</title><link>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/ctf_announcement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 17:40:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/ctf_announcement/</guid><description>CTF announcement</description></item><item><title>CTI League - Community Talk</title><link>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/cti_league_-_community_talk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 17:20:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/cti_league_-_community_talk/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Volunteering during crisis - CTI League, a global threat intelligence experts community that neutralize cyber threats exploiting the current COVID-19 pandemic &amp;quot;</description></item><item><title>Free Blue-Team TTPs: Stop Shiny Object Syndrome</title><link>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/free_blue-team_ttps_stop_shiny_object_syndrome/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 16:10:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/free_blue-team_ttps_stop_shiny_object_syndrome/</guid><description>Too many blue-teamers get dazzled by hype for fancy new tools, especially those that are new to the industry. What they don&amp;rsquo;t realize is that there are free or cheap Tools, Tactics and Procedures that can shore up defenses today, without having to buy something new.</description></item><item><title>The Art of C2: Myths vs. Reality</title><link>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/the_art_of_c2_myths_vs._reality/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 15:55:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/the_art_of_c2_myths_vs._reality/</guid><description>“You need a TCP/IP connection for a C’n’C Server”, don&amp;rsquo;t you?? a dynamic, real-time Command and Control is not about an established connection. Nor TCP. or UDP. It’s a MINDSET :) We&amp;rsquo;ll show you some cool demos from our research and tools we wrote for our creative assessments, demonstrating C&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;C &amp;ldquo;living of the land&amp;rdquo; with your email client, Bluetooth with text messages, SSIDs and even dropped packets ;-)</description></item><item><title>Eliminating Alert Fatigue: Reducing False Positives Through Better Engineering</title><link>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/eliminating_alert_fatigue_reducing_false_positives_through_better_engineering/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 15:25:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/eliminating_alert_fatigue_reducing_false_positives_through_better_engineering/</guid><description>False Positive alerts are the bane of blue teams everywhere. Countless hours are lost as Security Operation Center analysts attempt to separate the wheat from the alert chaff to find the real indicators of an attack. Reducing FPs is thus a critical goal for any security platform. Yet reducing FPs at the expense of missing the signs of an actual threat is inviting disaster. The solution to this conundrum lies in better engineering: building the right tools to accurately assess alerts at scale.</description></item><item><title>Shatter Reloaded: Reviving shatter attacks to escape sandboxes and evade endpoint security products</title><link>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/shatter_reloaded_reviving_shatter_attacks_to_escape_sandboxes_and_evade_endpoint_security_products/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 14:30:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/shatter_reloaded_reviving_shatter_attacks_to_escape_sandboxes_and_evade_endpoint_security_products/</guid><description>Shatter attacks were all the rage in 2003 but were quickly neutralized by DEP, UIPI and Session 0 isolation. 15 years later, confronted with a commercial sandbox and with state-of-the-art endpoint security products – we brought Shatter attacks back to life, extending and weaponizing them to be useful once more. In this talk, we’ll present a novel code injection technique that uses an enhanced shatter attack to stealthily inject code into window explorer on Win7 &amp;amp; Win10.</description></item><item><title>Now You TCP Me, Now You Don't: The Strengths and Weaknesses of Various Internet Scanning Services</title><link>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/now_you_tcp_me_now_you_dont_the_strengths_and_weaknesses_of_various_internet_scanning_services/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 14:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/now_you_tcp_me_now_you_dont_the_strengths_and_weaknesses_of_various_internet_scanning_services/</guid><description>A wild router is connected to the web! Are Shodan and Censys the only ones who index it? Absolutely not! They are only two of the many internet scanning services that let users interact with port scanning data they routinely collect. Although their names are well-known, details about them, the data they gather, and how best to use them are more word-of-mouth than common knowledge. I will explore these and other lesser-known websites, and help security researchers understand their strengths.</description></item><item><title>Regipy: Automating registry forensics with python</title><link>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/regipy_automating_registry_forensics_with_python/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 13:05:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/regipy_automating_registry_forensics_with_python/</guid><description>Regipy is an OS independent python library for parsing offline registry hives. Regipy can be used to parse registry hives in scale (collected from hundreds of machines) and a lot of interesting data analysis can be done on the results, as I intend to show in the Demo. The demo would be very practical and show how the results of Regipy can be useful to crack a forensic case. (See a small example in the blog post attached)</description></item><item><title>Dr. J’Apple and Mr. Hyde - Uncovering covert malware infestation of Apple’s iOS AppStore</title><link>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/dr._japple_and_mr._hyde_-_uncovering_covert_malware_infestation_of_apples_ios_appstore/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 12:35:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/dr._japple_and_mr._hyde_-_uncovering_covert_malware_infestation_of_apples_ios_appstore/</guid><description>This talk will uncover an on-going operation of infestation of Apple&amp;rsquo;s iOS AppStore with covert malware.</description></item><item><title>ROP - From Zero to Nation State In 25 Minutes</title><link>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/rop_-_from_zero_to_nation_state_in_25_minutes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 12:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/rop_-_from_zero_to_nation_state_in_25_minutes/</guid><description>“The only interesting answers are those which destroy the questions.” ― Susan Sontag
Roll up your sleeves and prepare for hands on demonstration of transforming a simple process injection into a new improved version of Stack Bombing that will evade most detection tools.
We will focus on building a ROP and take a &amp;ldquo;CI/CD&amp;rdquo; approach to process injection, continuously improving the same code to evade detection and mitigation techniques.</description></item><item><title>WhoAmI, anyway?</title><link>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/whoami_anyway/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 11:25:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/whoami_anyway/</guid><description>All InfoSec challenges today may be traced back to the design mindset of the Internet Protocol Suite in the late 60&amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp; early 70&amp;rsquo;s: non-repudiation, confidentiality, spoofing etc’ were Not in the design goals of TCP/IP. Decades after, we’re creatively &amp;amp; immensely manipulating time &amp;amp; space over the internet. Malware uses deception to evade defenses, defenders use deception to deter adversaries. Attribution of actions to entities becomes challenging than ever. So WhoAreWe, anyway?</description></item><item><title>Opening words</title><link>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/opening_words/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 11:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bsidestlv.com/agenda/opening_words/</guid><description>Opening words</description></item></channel></rss>
