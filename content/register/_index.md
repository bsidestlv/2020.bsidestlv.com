## BSidesTLV 2020 - Hybrid Edition! Welcome To The New Normal...

The time has come for us to go hybrid, gather together and share our knowledge!

## What to expect at BSidesTLV 2020 Hybrid edition?

A hybrid event is a mix of both in-person talks and online experiences. Our selected speakers will present live, in-person and we will be live-streaming the entire day to all of our participants. We will also have prize-winning competitions, CTF winners announcements and of course, live Q&A with our speakers, as well as “lobbycon” chatrooms to give everyone space to socialize!

Join us for a full day of the best security research content this side of the Mediterranean, with cutting edge content, community talks, live demos and all of the fun and excitement you have come to expect from BsidesTLV ! Join in for the live talks, chat with your friends and meet our sponsors who want to hire you.
