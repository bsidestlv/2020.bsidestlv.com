## The BSidesTLV 2020 CFP is now open!

Choose from 10, 25, 45 minutes talks, or give a special "underground" talk!
Our CFP will remain open until March 15, 2020.
The conference theme this year is CyberPunk, The science fiction genre focusing on near-future- "high tech & low life" dystopian visions of a hyper-technological future, with hackers as the genre's heroes and anti heroes. The Cyberpunk theme means that alongside our regular security research CFP topics we are also looking for talks about bio-hacking, surveillance tech and counter-tech, cool hacks of embedded devices/hardware hacking and anything that sparks your imagination and is a little bit "science fiction".
Ready to imagine that future with us? submit your talks https://cfp.bsidestlv.com/20/cfp until March 15!
