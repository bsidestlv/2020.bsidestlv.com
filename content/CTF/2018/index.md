## Running a Fair Game
Yesterday, June 9th at 18:26 we discovered that someone has shared the flag for one of our challenges on Pastebin.

Obviously, we considered this before starting the CTF and made a decision to trust our community and the rules of the game would be played fairly, and we still believe that the vast majority of the playing teams or playing for fun and do so fairly.

However, we couldnâ€™t let one of our flags (worth 1,000 points!) run around free, so we made a difficult choice. Even though the likelihood of further spreading of that flag is minimal, we modified the challenge slightly to include another step in the flag creation, making the original flag obsolete.

this is on no way the fault of the hard-working, serious players who were hurt by this decision, but rather a way for us to move forward and keeping (a rather excellent) challenge with us â€“ without using the original flag.

as to the people behind the leaked flag, and the submission of the leaked flag to get points â€“ we took their word that this was not intentional, and we are keeping a close watch for the rest of the competition.

Please play fairly! both for your sake, and for the fun of everyone else!
